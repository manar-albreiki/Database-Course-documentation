Types of Databases


1. Relational Databases (RDBMS)

* Stores data in structured tables with rows and columns.
* Relationships are enforced using primary and foreign keys.
* Best for applications requiring consistent and accurate data.
* Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.
* Use cases: Banking systems, e-commerce platforms, HR management systems.

2. Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)

* Stores data in flexible formats such as documents, key-value pairs, wide-column, or graphs.
* Schema-less design allows handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.
* Ideal for applications requiring scalability and fast access to diverse data.
* Examples: MongoDB (document), Cassandra (wide-column), Redis (key-value), Neo4j (graph).
* Use cases: Social media apps, IoT applications, real-time analytics, content management systems.

3. Centralized Databases

* All data is stored in a single server or location.
* Simple to manage and maintain, but limited scalability.
* Use cases: Small businesses or single-location organizations.

4. Distributed Databases

* Data is stored across multiple servers or physical locations.
* Provides scalability, fault tolerance, and high availability.
* Use cases: Global banking systems, airline reservation networks, logistics platforms.

5. Cloud Databases

* Hosted on cloud infrastructure and managed by cloud providers.
* Offers scalability, automatic backups, high availability, and remote access.
* Can be relational or non-relational.
* Use cases: SaaS applications, e-commerce platforms, mobile apps, big data platforms.

Cloud Storage and Databases

Cloud Storage and Its Relation to Databases

* Cloud storage is a service that allows data to be stored and accessed over the internet rather than on local servers or personal devices.
* Databases can be hosted on cloud storage, allowing them to run as cloud-based databases. This means the database software, storage, and infrastructure are managed by cloud providers.
* Cloud databases can be relational or non-relational, and users can access them remotely from anywhere with an internet connection.

Advantages of Cloud-Based Databases

* Scalability: Can easily scale storage and compute resources up or down according to demand.
* Accessibility: Accessible from anywhere, supporting remote work and distributed teams.
* Managed Services: Providers handle maintenance, updates, backups, and security.
* High Availability: Cloud providers offer redundancy and failover options for continuous operation.
* Cost Efficiency: Pay-as-you-go pricing reduces upfront hardware and maintenance costs.

Disadvantages of Cloud-Based Databases

* Internet Dependency: Requires a stable internet connection to access the database.
* Data Security Concerns: Sensitive data is stored offsite, which may raise security and privacy issues.
* Limited Control: Less direct control over server configuration and database management compared to on-premises databases.
* Potential Latency: Access speed may be slower than local servers depending on internet and server location.
* Ongoing Costs: Long-term costs can add up, especially for large-scale databases or high usage.

Examples of Cloud-Based Databases

* Azure SQL Database
* Amazon RDS
* Google Cloud Spanner

Database Engines and Languages


What is a Database Engine?

* A database engine is the core software component of a database system that stores, retrieves, and manages data.
* It handles tasks like query processing, transaction management, indexing, and data storage.
* Essentially, it is the “heart” of a database system that executes commands and manages data efficiently.

Examples of Database Engines

* SQL Server
* MySQL
* Oracle Database
* PostgreSQL

Languages Used by Database Engines

* SQL Server uses T-SQL (Transact-SQL), an extension of standard SQL.
* Oracle uses PL/SQL (Procedural Language/SQL), which adds procedural programming features to SQL.
* MySQL and PostgreSQL use standard ANSI SQL, though PostgreSQL also supports procedural extensions like PL/pgSQL.

Relationship Between Engine and Language

* The database engine interprets and executes commands written in its supported query language.
* Some engines have proprietary extensions (like T-SQL or PL/SQL) to add extra functionality beyond standard SQL.
* The choice of engine often dictates which language or extensions you use.

Cross-Engine Language Compatibility

* Standard SQL commands (ANSI SQL) can work across multiple database engines.
* However, proprietary extensions (T-SQL, PL/SQL) are specific to their engine and may not run on other databases without modification.
* Developers often use standard SQL for basic queries and engine-specific features when advanced functionality is needed.

Is it possible to migrate a database between engines?

* Yes, it is possible to migrate a database from one engine to another, for example, SQL Server to MySQL, or Oracle to PostgreSQL.
* Migration can involve exporting the schema and data, then importing it into the target database, often using migration tools or scripts.

Challenges of engine-to-engine migration

* Differences in SQL dialects and proprietary extensions (e.g., T-SQL vs PL/SQL).
* Differences in data types; a column type in one engine may not exist in the other.
* Differences in indexing, constraints, triggers, and stored procedures.
* Potential issues with default values, auto-increment fields, or sequences.
* Maintaining data integrity and relationships during the transfer.
* Performance tuning may be required after migration, as query optimization differs by engine.

Considerations before transferring

* Review and map all data types between source and target engines.
* Check triggers, stored procedures, views, and functions for compatibility or rewrite them.
* Plan for differences in auto-increment fields, sequences, and default values.
* Ensure that constraints (primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints) are preserved.
* Evaluate any engine-specific features or extensions used in the source database.
* Test the migration with sample data to identify issues before full production migration.

Logical vs. Physical Schema

What is the Logical Schema in database design?

* The logical schema defines how data is organized conceptually, independent of how it will be physically stored.
* It shows tables, columns, data types, relationships, and constraints in a way that models the business requirements.
* Focuses on *what* data is stored and *how* it relates.

What is the Physical Schema?

* The physical schema defines how data is actually stored on disk or in the database system.
* It includes file structures, indexes, storage details, partitions, and performance optimization.
* Focuses on *how* data is implemented and accessed efficiently.

Difference between Logical and Physical Schemas

* Logical schema is conceptual; physical schema is implementation-specific.
* Logical schema ignores storage details; physical schema considers storage, indexing, and performance.
* Logical schema is more about structure and relationships; physical schema is about efficiency and actual database engine implementation.

Why is it important to understand both?

* Logical schema ensures that the database meets business and user requirements.
* Physical schema ensures that the database performs efficiently and can handle large volumes of data.
* Understanding both helps in designing a database that is correct, scalable, and optimized.

Example: Student Entity

Logical Schema:

* Table: Student

  * Columns: StudentID, Name, DateOfBirth, Major
  * Primary Key: StudentID
  * Relationships: Major linked to Department table

Physical Schema:

* Table: Student

  * Columns: StudentID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, Name VARCHAR(50), DateOfBirth DATE, MajorID INT
  * Index on MajorID for faster queries
  * Storage engine: InnoDB (for MySQL)
