- Database Developer
A database developer builds and implements the database based on the design. They write SQL queries, stored procedures, triggers, and functions, ensuring that the database supports applications efficiently and accurately.

- DBA (Database Administrator)
A DBA manages and maintains the database after it is deployed. Their duties include monitoring performance, controlling user access, performing backups and recovery, and ensuring data security, reliability, and availability.

- Application Developer
An application developer creates the software that interacts with the database. They develop user interfaces and application logic, ensuring the system communicates with the database correctly while providing a smooth user experience.

- BI (Business Intelligence) Developer
A BI developer works with data to support decision-making. They design dashboards, reports, and analytics solutions, transforming raw data into meaningful insights using tools like Power BI, Tableau, or SQL-based reporting.
