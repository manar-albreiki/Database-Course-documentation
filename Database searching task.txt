3. Roles in a Database System

- System Analyst
A system analyst studies the needs of an organization and determines how technology can solve business problems. They act as a bridge between users and technical teams, analyzing requirements, creating system specifications, and ensuring the final solution meets user expectations.

- Database Designer
A database designer is responsible for planning how data will be stored, structured, and organized. They create the conceptual, logical, and physical database models, ensuring efficiency, proper relationships, and normalization before development begins.

- Database Developer
A database developer builds and implements the database based on the design. They write SQL queries, stored procedures, triggers, and functions, ensuring that the database supports applications efficiently and accurately.

- DBA (Database Administrator)
A DBA manages and maintains the database after it is deployed. Their duties include monitoring performance, controlling user access, performing backups and recovery, and ensuring data security, reliability, and availability.

- Application Developer
An application developer creates the software that interacts with the database. They develop user interfaces and application logic, ensuring the system communicates with the database correctly while providing a smooth user experience.

- BI (Business Intelligence) Developer
A BI developer works with data to support decision-making. They design dashboards, reports, and analytics solutions, transforming raw data into meaningful insights using tools like Power BI, Tableau, or SQL-based reporting.

Here’s the **Types of Databases mind map content in clear bullet-point format with descriptions**:

Types of Databases


1. Relational Databases (RDBMS)

* Stores data in structured tables with rows and columns.
* Relationships are enforced using primary and foreign keys.
* Best for applications requiring consistent and accurate data.
* Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.
* Use cases: Banking systems, e-commerce platforms, HR management systems.

2. Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)

* Stores data in flexible formats such as documents, key-value pairs, wide-column, or graphs.
* Schema-less design allows handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.
* Ideal for applications requiring scalability and fast access to diverse data.
* Examples: MongoDB (document), Cassandra (wide-column), Redis (key-value), Neo4j (graph).
* Use cases: Social media apps, IoT applications, real-time analytics, content management systems.

3. Centralized Databases

* All data is stored in a single server or location.
* Simple to manage and maintain, but limited scalability.
* Use cases: Small businesses or single-location organizations.

4. Distributed Databases

* Data is stored across multiple servers or physical locations.
* Provides scalability, fault tolerance, and high availability.
* Use cases: Global banking systems, airline reservation networks, logistics platforms.

5. Cloud Databases

* Hosted on cloud infrastructure and managed by cloud providers.
* Offers scalability, automatic backups, high availability, and remote access.
* Can be relational or non-relational.
* Use cases: SaaS applications, e-commerce platforms, mobile apps, big data platforms.

Cloud Storage and Databases

Cloud Storage and Its Relation to Databases

* Cloud storage is a service that allows data to be stored and accessed over the internet rather than on local servers or personal devices.
* Databases can be hosted on cloud storage, allowing them to run as cloud-based databases. This means the database software, storage, and infrastructure are managed by cloud providers.
* Cloud databases can be relational or non-relational, and users can access them remotely from anywhere with an internet connection.

Advantages of Cloud-Based Databases

* Scalability: Can easily scale storage and compute resources up or down according to demand.
* Accessibility: Accessible from anywhere, supporting remote work and distributed teams.
* Managed Services: Providers handle maintenance, updates, backups, and security.
* High Availability: Cloud providers offer redundancy and failover options for continuous operation.
* Cost Efficiency: Pay-as-you-go pricing reduces upfront hardware and maintenance costs.

Disadvantages of Cloud-Based Databases

* Internet Dependency: Requires a stable internet connection to access the database.
* Data Security Concerns: Sensitive data is stored offsite, which may raise security and privacy issues.
* Limited Control: Less direct control over server configuration and database management compared to on-premises databases.
* Potential Latency: Access speed may be slower than local servers depending on internet and server location.
* Ongoing Costs: Long-term costs can add up, especially for large-scale databases or high usage.

Examples of Cloud-Based Databases

* Azure SQL Database
* Amazon RDS
* Google Cloud Spanner

Database Engines and Languages


What is a Database Engine?

* A database engine is the core software component of a database system that stores, retrieves, and manages data.
* It handles tasks like query processing, transaction management, indexing, and data storage.
* Essentially, it is the “heart” of a database system that executes commands and manages data efficiently.

Examples of Database Engines

* SQL Server
* MySQL
* Oracle Database
* PostgreSQL

Languages Used by Database Engines

* SQL Server uses T-SQL (Transact-SQL), an extension of standard SQL.
* Oracle uses PL/SQL (Procedural Language/SQL), which adds procedural programming features to SQL.
* MySQL and PostgreSQL use standard ANSI SQL, though PostgreSQL also supports procedural extensions like PL/pgSQL.

Relationship Between Engine and Language

* The database engine interprets and executes commands written in its supported query language.
* Some engines have proprietary extensions (like T-SQL or PL/SQL) to add extra functionality beyond standard SQL.
* The choice of engine often dictates which language or extensions you use.

Cross-Engine Language Compatibility

* Standard SQL commands (ANSI SQL) can work across multiple database engines.
* However, proprietary extensions (T-SQL, PL/SQL) are specific to their engine and may not run on other databases without modification.
* Developers often use standard SQL for basic queries and engine-specific features when advanced functionality is needed.
