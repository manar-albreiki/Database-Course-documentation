3. Roles in a Database System

- System Analyst
A system analyst studies the needs of an organization and determines how technology can solve business problems. They act as a bridge between users and technical teams, analyzing requirements, creating system specifications, and ensuring the final solution meets user expectations.

- Database Designer
A database designer is responsible for planning how data will be stored, structured, and organized. They create the conceptual, logical, and physical database models, ensuring efficiency, proper relationships, and normalization before development begins.

- Database Developer
A database developer builds and implements the database based on the design. They write SQL queries, stored procedures, triggers, and functions, ensuring that the database supports applications efficiently and accurately.

- DBA (Database Administrator)
A DBA manages and maintains the database after it is deployed. Their duties include monitoring performance, controlling user access, performing backups and recovery, and ensuring data security, reliability, and availability.

- Application Developer
An application developer creates the software that interacts with the database. They develop user interfaces and application logic, ensuring the system communicates with the database correctly while providing a smooth user experience.

- BI (Business Intelligence) Developer
A BI developer works with data to support decision-making. They design dashboards, reports, and analytics solutions, transforming raw data into meaningful insights using tools like Power BI, Tableau, or SQL-based reporting.

Here’s the **Types of Databases mind map content in clear bullet-point format with descriptions**:

Types of Databases


1. Relational Databases (RDBMS)

* Stores data in structured tables with rows and columns.
* Relationships are enforced using primary and foreign keys.
* Best for applications requiring consistent and accurate data.
* Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.
* Use cases: Banking systems, e-commerce platforms, HR management systems.

2. Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)

* Stores data in flexible formats such as documents, key-value pairs, wide-column, or graphs.
* Schema-less design allows handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.
* Ideal for applications requiring scalability and fast access to diverse data.
* Examples: MongoDB (document), Cassandra (wide-column), Redis (key-value), Neo4j (graph).
* Use cases: Social media apps, IoT applications, real-time analytics, content management systems.

3. Centralized Databases

* All data is stored in a single server or location.
* Simple to manage and maintain, but limited scalability.
* Use cases: Small businesses or single-location organizations.

4. Distributed Databases

* Data is stored across multiple servers or physical locations.
* Provides scalability, fault tolerance, and high availability.
* Use cases: Global banking systems, airline reservation networks, logistics platforms.

5. Cloud Databases

* Hosted on cloud infrastructure and managed by cloud providers.
* Offers scalability, automatic backups, high availability, and remote access.
* Can be relational or non-relational.
* Use cases: SaaS applications, e-commerce platforms, mobile apps, big data platforms.
